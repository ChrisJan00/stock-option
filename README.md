Made at the Berlin Mini Game Jam August 2015.

Code based on the base simple game from Gregg Tavares for the [HappyFunTimes party games system](http://greggman.github.io/HappyFunTimes).

You will need to download and install HappyFunTimes in order to play this game.

The game starts automatically when at least 2 players are connected.  You can reset it explicitly by pressing space bar at any time.
